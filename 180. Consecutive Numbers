Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

select distinct l1.Num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs l1, (select distinct l2.Id, l2.Num from Logs l2, Logs l3
               where l2.Num = l3.Num and l2.Id = l3.Id - 1) as l
where l1.Num = l.Num and l1.Id = l.Id - 1
